            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>1-2 slices of cheese (cheddar, american)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Place one slice, butter-side down, in a pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese on top, then place the second slice of bread on top, butter-side up.</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side until golden and the cheese is melted.</li>
